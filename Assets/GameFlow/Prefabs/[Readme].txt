GameFlow - Prefabs folder
-------------------------

The Prefabs folder is organized in subfolders grouping prefabs by type:

- Prefabs/Gamefabs - These are ready-to-use prefabs containing GameFlow program that you can instantiate in your scene to add a specific functionality to your game. Example: "Pause Controller" to automatically have the ability to pause/resume your game with a key.

- Prefabs/Utilities - These are small tools for the Unity Editor programmed with GameFlow that will be shown as floating windows (also called "Utility" windows). Just double click on the desired prefab file to show it in a window.
