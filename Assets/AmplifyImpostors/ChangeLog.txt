Release Notes:
v0.9.1
* Fixes:
    * Fixed issue where custom baking would fail because of broken overrides
    * Overrides now setup the initial value of each individual field properly
* Improvements:
    * Baker now ignores disabled renderers and renderers that are marked as "shadows only"
    * Other small changes and improvements

v0.9.0
* Improvements:
    * Added support for Custom Map Baking when generating impostors with both a custom bake shader and a custom runtime shader
    * Added "Baking Presets" that allows per output customization, each output can be overridden and has the following fields:
        * File output toggle
        * Name Suffix
        * Texture relative Scale
        * Texture color space
        * Texture channels
        * Texture import compression quality
        * File save format (PNG and TGA)
    * New sample with custom baking in which the final impostors share the dynamic colors from the original object
    * Added TGA saving file format which greatly reduces saving time when baking (only uncompressed format for now so keep in mind disk space)
    * Various others smaller improvements to speed up the baking and saving times
    * ASE impostor node now allows the use of custom maps
    * Added progress bar when baking
    * Mesh billboard editor tool now doesn't automatically updates the image and instead displays a update button, this should prevent some UI hangs when editing some fields
    * Added metallic template and metallic workflow option to impostor node for custom impostor rendering
* Fixes:
    * Fixed errors when baking an object with a corrupt mesh
    * Fixed issue where on first bake renderers would fail to automatically set if there was only one LOD
    * Fixed issue with a built-in shader value not being set properly when baking (should fix parallax UBER shader baking)
    * Some small UI and default options fixes
